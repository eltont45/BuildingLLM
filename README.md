# BuildingLLM From Scratch
## Overview
This repository contains an LLM implementation from scratch that follows along from Dr. Raj Dandekar's Youtube Series: [Building LLMs from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpr8D6LeAtw&list=PLPTV0NXA_ZSgsLAr8YCgCwhPIJNNtexWu&ab_channel=Vizuara). Dr. Raj Dandekar recognizes that his key reference very closely follows Build a Large Language Model from Scratch by Manning Publications. In this repository we will be building this LLM from scratch, documenting our progress by highlighting key notes, and then finetuning the model with data from research papers.
## Purpose
This repository documents my learning and understanding of Large Language Models. I also add my own finetuning. This repository welcomes all to also learn LLM's and to showcase how I finetune my model.
